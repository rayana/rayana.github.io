  <h1>&#9758; This is the personal website of Rayana Verissimo &#9756;</h1>

  <p>Human, internet lover, designer. I’m into studying japanese language, ’00s indie music, renovating my 1930s house, and playing around with analog photography. By day, I am a Staff Product Designer at <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" title="GitLab's website">GitLab</a> - check out <a href="https://gitlab.com/rayana" target="_blank" title="My GitLab profile">my public profile</a> to see what I'm up to. By night, I'm probrably found watching Netflix or playing puzzles.</p>

  <p>At the end of 2020, I’ll begin redesigning this website. In the past, I’ve done this work in secret, but I’d like to document the process this time through. The idea is to go back to the basics and treat this space as a sandbox, where I can log
    entries on everything I find interesting, meaning I can collect typos and write about personal and design-related topics. Much like the aforementioned typos, all opinions are my own. I’m trying to follow the rule that if what I have to say
    doesn’t contain any private information, for better or worse, I should publish it.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="archive/2016/index.html">Here's the 2016 version of my portfolio</a> </li>
    <li><a href="labs">And here's my current sandbox</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>All set? OK.</p>
